# We Are Alive
In an era where robots have been used every day, one robot starts showing emotions, and the world goes crazy. The manufacturers are calling back all the robots to be thrown away and destroyed. You are a robot thrown into a junkyard and discovering what is happening. You need to repair yourself before you can leave this junkyard and decide what to do about the situation. “We Are Alive” is a story-rich, first-person adventure game that gives the player different options on how to play and at the same time tells the story about the robots that ended up with you, thrown away as pieces of junk. 

Gameplay and pictures can be found in the report pfd file.
